"I had the pleasure of having my new roof installed by Priceless Home Improvements. My Inspection Specialist was Jaye Hayman. It was a joy working with Jaye. He explained everything in great detail. He was very attentive, and made sure I understood every aspect of the process. He was very timely, and provided a great deal of guidance along the way. I would definitely recommend Jaye and Priceless Home Improvements to my friends and family!"

"Great experience with Priceless Home Improvements. Gayle Fraser was my POC. I was definitely in need of a new roof. Gayle always communicated with me the next step and always showed up as scheduled. Priceless, as a whole, made me feel comfortable with the process. As a matter of fact, Priceless communicated better than my insurance company. My house looks great."

"I highly recommend Priceless Home Improvements and their Team specifically Jay who successfully managed the project from the beginning to the end."

"I had some shingles fly off during a windstorm. Called Priceless and Rob arrived promptly as scheduled. After his assessment it was clear my damage was extensive and it was suggested I make an insurance claim. Priceless worked with my insurance company to complete the claim and get the work done. It was a very easy process for this homeowner. Great job by Rob and the Priceless Team."
